# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component solution

This is my resolution to the "NFT preview card component" challenge, from frontendmentor.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- A bit flexbox things
- A lot of love and dedication :D

### The process

This challenge is very similar to the last one I did (QR card component). The only difference was adding active effects to some elements (which I chose to replace with hover).

Through the development of this project, the most difficult thing to do (which, in fact, I couldn't solve at all) was applying the hover effect to the Equilibrium NFT image. I also realised that I'm not really into color stuff (brightness, contrast, opacity, etc), so I would like to strengthen my knowledge on that area. Finally, I discovered the filter property, which I think it's a really useful tool for modifying images. It has a lot of utilities and I'm sure I will study it in the future.

### Useful resources

- https://cssgenerator.org/filter-css-generator.html - Even I couldn't use it because I didn't know very well this property, I found this really useful tool that allows you to regulate with bars every feature of the filter property. However, if you search "CSS filter generator" on google, you will find a lot similar to this one.
